<h1>RPM Plugin for Eclipse</h1>
<!-- Version 1.?  Introduction  The RPM Plugin for Eclipse enables 
 you to manage 
 Linux <b>RPM</b> software packages. You can easily import 
 source RPMs and 
 re-export them as source and/or binary RPMs. -->
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the RPM package format, creating the
files necessary to generate a properly formatted, installable <span
 class="filename">.rpm</span> file can be a complex process. The RPM
Plugin for Eclipse provides you with an automated method of creating
RPM packages from simple C/C++ projects.
You can also import previously-created source RPMs, modify them, and
re-export them in both binary and source format with minimal effort.
The resulting packages will be ready to install on any Linux system.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>
If there are features regarding RPM you would like to see implemented
or want to report a bug or recommend a feature be added, go to <a
 href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Linux%20Distros&component=RPM" target="_blank">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Linux%20Distros&component=RPM</a>.
Then, either enter a feature request or bug report under the <span
 class="guilabel">LinuxTools &gt; RPM</span> section in bugzilla.
</p>
<h2>RPM Plugin Preference Page Setup</h2>
<p>Before using the RPM plugin, you should set default values in the
RPM plugin's preference page. To get to the <b>RPM plugin Preferences</b>
page, click <b>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; RPM Plugin</b>.
The screen below is displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/01_eclipse_rpm_prefs_page1.png"></p>
<p>There are several fields you can change. The first two fields are
values the RPM plugin will use to populate the changelog section of the
<span class="filename">spec</span> files. The first line of a <span
 class="filename">spec</span> file changelog entry typically looks like
this:</p>
<pre>* Thu May 27, 2004  John Smith  &lt;jsmith@mydomain.com&gt;<br></pre>
<p>When a change is made to a project and the RPM plugin is used to
export it as a source RPM, the <b>Author Name</b> and <b>Author E-mail</b>
fields are used as the default values to place in the changelog line
section of the spec file. A screen is presented that enables you to
change the directory where the RPM plugin will create a temporary work
area using your userid. In the above example, if the default <code>/var/tmp</code>
is used, the RPM plugin will create a work area under <code>/var/tmp/jsmith</code>
during an RPM import/export operation. All directories under <code>/var/tmp/jsmith</code>
will be deleted after the import/export is complete.
If the import/export aborts for any reason, the work area will remain
intact so that you can debug any problems, in which case the work area
will be deleted when the next
import/export is attempted.
</p>
<p>For the time being, the RPM plugin actually shells out and executes
commands to perform the necessary functions to import/export RPMs.
(In the future, Java bindings for RPM will be explored.)
In the "Shell Commands" section, you are given the opportunity to
change the actual shell commands that the RPM plugin uses.
These commands default to the standard
locations for most Linux installations, but you can change them to
point to the proper locations of these commands on your system.
</p>
<h2>Import of SRPM (Source RPM)</h2>
<p>One of the features of the RPM Manipulation plugin is the ability to
import C/C++ source that is in packaged in <b>srpm</b> format into an
Eclipse C/C++ project. A selection has been added to the screen that is
displayed when the Eclipse <b>File &gt; Import</b> pulldown item is
selected. This allows you to quickly and easily import source RPMs into
the Eclipse development environment.</p>
<h3>Invoking the Eclipse SRPM Import Feature for C/C++ Projects</h3>
<p>Invoking the SRPM Import feature of Eclipse is a very simple matter.
At the top of the Eclipse click on <b>File</b> which causes a pulldown
menu to appear. From this menu click on <b>Import</b>. This causes the
screen below to appear:</p>
<p><img src="../images/04_eclipse_rpm_srpm_import.png"></p>
<p>From this screen select <b>Source RPM</b> and then <b>Next</b> to
activate the next screen shown here:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../images/05_eclipse_rpm_srpm_import.png"
 style="width: 525px; height: 564px;"><br>
</p>
<p>There are three functions that this screen must perform in order to
successfully import a source RPM into Eclipse. The first thing you must
do is select a source RPM to be imported using the <b>Browse</b>
button. When this button is depressed the following window is presented.</p>
<p><img src="../images/06_eclipse_rpm_srpm_import.png"></p>
<p>This screen is used to <b>browse</b> around a system to the desired
source RPM. As can be seen from the right side of the screen, all
source RPMs have the extension <tt>.src.rpm</tt>.
Once the desired source RPM is found, either double-click on it or
single-click and then click <b>OK</b>. The source RPMs name should now
appear in the <b>SRPM Name</b> window.</p>
<p>Next, either select the already-existing C/C++ project where this
source RPM will be imported or click on the "Check out as a project
using the New Project Wizard" button. If you select the latter, the
C/C++ project wizard pops up and guides you through the process of
creating a new C/C++ project.&nbsp; Once the wizard is done, the import
process begins automatically.&nbsp; If there is a project already
created you want to import into, the <b>Select a project</b> window
contains a list of the available Eclipse C/C++ projects. Scroll to the
desired project and select it so it is highlighted and click on
"Finish".<br>
</p>
<p>Now, the <b>Build Options</b> window probably already has the
options selected that you typically want when a source RPM is to be
imported. That is, most of the time you will want all of the patches
applied and will want <b>configure</b> run so the project is ready to
run make after it is imported. If either one or the other option is not
desired, unselect either one or both by clicking on the appropriate
boxes to the left of the screen.</p>
<p>Once all of the fields have been set to the desired state, to
complete the source RPM import function simply click <b>Finish</b>.
This activates a sequence that, again, could possibly take
quite a while depending on the size of the RPM. If <b>Run AutoConf</b>
has been selected, it could take a while for the <b>configure</b>
script to run.</p>
<p><img src="../images/07_eclipse_rpm_srpm_import_2.png"
 alt="SRPM Import progress bar screenshot here"
 style="width: 525px; height: 550px;"><br>
</p>
<p>A progress-bar indicates what step the import process is executing,
but not necessarily how long has been taken or is remaining. Once this
step is successfully completed, the window disappears and the project
can be viewed in the Eclipse <b>C/C++ project</b> view as shown in the
figure below.</p>
<p><img src="../images/08_eclipse_rpm_cproject_view.png"></p>
<p>Now you can use all of the resources of Eclipse on this imported
C/C++ project just as any other project. Notice that the source RPM
that was selected for import has been copied into the project. The
source RPM will be required if you make changes to the project and
wants to export it as a patched source RPM. The original source RPM
will be installed and compared against the current source in the
Eclipse project to create a patch.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="important">Important: </span>
Not all source RPMs will be able to be imported as the formats various
maintainers varies widely. An effort has been made to accommodate as
many of the formats as possible. If you find a source RPM that cannot
be imported, please file a bug report with the Eclipse project. There
is no guarantee that we can fix the problem, but if the source RPM is
in a reasonable format every effort will be made to get the RPM Plugin
to handle it. Sometimes it may make more sense if the source RPM is
modified to be more in line with most of the other source RPM formats.</p>
<h3>RPM Plugin-created files</h3>
<p>To facilitate the later exporting of this project as a binary or
source RPM, the RPM plugin creates two files that hold vital
information: <tt>.srpminfo</tt> and <tt><i>eclipse_packagename</i></tt>.
</p>
<p>Generally you should not modify these files�particularly the <b>.srpminfo</b>
file. This file contains five lines, one which contains the name of the
source RPM from which this project was imported.</p>
<p>Part of the import process is to copy the source RPM (which ends
with <tt>.src.rpm</tt>) into the project to ensure there is a copy
should you try to export this project as a source RPM. If this project
is to be re-exported as a source RPM, the RPM plugin will need to
re-install the original source RPM from which this project was created
in order to generate a proper patch to be included in the new source
RPM. This also implies that the original source RPM should not be
deleted or renamed until a new source RPM is created. <tt>.srpminfo</tt>
is modified by the RPM plugin when a source RPM is exported to point to
the new source RPM path, usually within the Eclipse project itself. It
is deleted before the source RPM is created, so it is not included with
the source code.</p>
<p>The <tt>eclipse_packagename.spec</tt> file is a copy of the spec
file from the <code>SPECS</code> directory from when the source RPM
was installed in the <code>/var/tmp/userid/...</code> temporary work
area. This spec file is modified by the RPM plugin appropriately when
either the binary or source RPM export operation is run. If you edit
this file, you do so at your own risk. It is <b><i>permanently</i></b>
modified by the RPM plugin <b><i>only</i></b> when a source RPM is
exported. Additional <tt>Patchx:/%patch</tt> statements are inserted
in the appropriate places and the version and/or release numbers are
updated if they are changed. Like the <tt>.srpminfo</tt> file, this
file is deleted by the RPM plugin before the source RPM is created so
the <tt>diff</tt> will not see it and include it in any patch that is
created.
</p>
<h3>RPM Plugin Export Feature Binary and Source</h3>
<p>The ability to export Eclipse C/C++ projects to binary and source
RPMs can be divided into two categories with sub-categories beneath
those:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Projects created from imported source RPMs
    <ul>
      <li>The RPM plugin modifies the previous spec file appropriately</li>
      <li>You provide a spec file</li>
      <li>The RPM generates a simple spec file (recommended only for
simple projects).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Projects that have never been RPMs
    <ul>
      <li>The RPM plugin generates a simple spec file</li>
      <li>You provide a spec file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to export only a binary RPM, the RPM plugin will
create a temporary spec file and patches to apply, but these will be
discarded after the creation of the binary RPM. That is, the <span
 class="filename"><i>eclipse_packagename</i>.spec</span> does not get
permanently modified. If a source RPM is created, the above-mentioned <span
 class="filename">spec</span> file is permanently modified and the <tt>.srpminfo</tt>
file is changed to now point to the new source RPM as its base.</p>
<h3>Invoking the Eclipse RPM Manipulation Methods</h3>
<p>Initiating the export of a simple C/C++ project to an RPM package is
very simple. Simply click <b>File &gt; Export</b> and a screen like
the one below appears:</p>
<p><img src="../images/09_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>This screen lists the selections to which an Eclipse project can be
exported. Notice one of the selections is <b>Source/Binary RPM</b>.
Make sure this is selected and click <b>Next</b>. That will bring you
to the next screen shown below:</p>
<p><img src="../images/10_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>This screen enables you to select a project to be turned into an RPM
format. Select a project to be exported in the <b>Select a project</b>
window. Notice as different projects are selected the values in the <b>SPEC
file</b>, <b>Version</b>, and <b>Release</b> fields change. If a
project is selected that has never been exported, those fields will be
blank. If a project is selected that has been imported/exported as an
RPM, those fields will contain info derived from the source RPM it was
imported from or from the last source RPM that was exported from this
project.</p>
<p>If you want to provide a spec file other than the one associated
with the RPM, use the <b>Browse</b> button to select the desired spec
file and that is the one that will be used to create the RPMs. If the
default <span class="filename">spec</span> file is used, it will be
modified by the RPM plugin with
the new version and/or release numbers entered by you and that will
become the new default <span class="filename">spec</span> file.</p>
<p>Sometimes the last box on the screen has information in it and
sometimes it does not. When a project is selected that has never been
exported before or has not been modified since it was last exported, no
information is shown, the <b>Next</b> button is grayed out, and the <b>Finish</b>
button is enabled:</p>
<p><img src="../images/11_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>On the screen above, you can change any of the three fields
associated with the project: <b>SPEC file</b>, <b>Version</b> or <b>Release</b>.
If no changes are made to the version and/or release fields and the <b>Finish</b>
button is clicked, the values in the fields will be used. This means,
depending on whether Binary RPM and/or Source RPM is selected, that the
previously-created source/binary RPMs with those version release
numbers will be overwritten inside the project.</p>
<p>If the <b>Patch Needed</b> information sign appears, then you can
modify any of the three fields and will be forced to click on the <b>Next</b>
button to enter information associated with creating a patch:</p>
<p><img src="../images/12_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>On this screen, you must enter data into the <b>Patch Tag</b> and <b>Changelog
Comment:</b> fields. It is recommended that even though default
information is supplied in the <b>Changelog Date Stamp:</b> field, you
should enter the correct data for the name and e-mail address portion
of the field. </p>
<p class="note"><span class="important">Warning: </span>
The format for the RPM changelog fields is very sensitive and should
not be changed.
Any changes may cause the RPM creation to fail when the <b>rpmbuild</b>
command is invoked.</p>
<p>Once the <b>Patch Tag</b> and <b>Changelog Comment:</b> fields
have data entered into them, the <b>Finish</b> button will be enabled.
Clicking on the <b>Finish</b> button will begin the RPM creation
sequence, which goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install the original source RPM pointed to by <tt>.srpminfo</tt></li>
  <li>Run the <b>configure</b> and the <b>make</b> commands</li>
  <li>Copy that RPM directory over to a duplicate directory with a <tt>.new</tt>
appended in preparation for generating a patch</li>
  <li>Copy the source from the appropriate Eclipse project to the
duplicate directory</li>
  <li>Run <b>make clean/distclean/maintainer-clean</b> command to
remove all extraneous files on both directories</li>
  <li>Use the <b>diff -uNr</b> command to generate a patch of the
differences between the directories</li>
  <li>If the version number changed, untar the master source and rename
the tarball to match the new version number</li>
  <li>Modify the spec file to add the <b>Patch:/%patch</b> statements
and modify the version and/or release numbers</li>
  <li>Use the <b>rpmbuild -b?</b> command to generate the requested
RPMs</li>
</ol>
<p>The following screen is shown with a progress bar indicating where
the RPM creation process currently is.</p>
<p><img src="../images/13_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>If the RPM creation process was successful, the <b>Export an SRPM</b>
screen will disappear and the requested RPMs will show up in the
Eclipse project that was exported. If the RPM creation process was
unsuccessful, an error screen like the one below appears:</p>
<p><img src="../images/14_eclipse_rpm_export.png"></p>
<p>Click <b>Details&gt;</b> to get more information about the error.
For every export (and import for that matter), a log file is created in
the designated RPM work area directory with a name formatted like: <tt><i>packagename-version-release-MMDD_HHMM.</i>rpmbuild.log</tt>.
The contents of this log should help you determine what caused the
error as it contains output from the processes that ran during the RPM
creation process.</p>
<p>You can view this logfile through the Eclipse <b>Console</b> view
by activating the RPM plugin log viewer. Click <b>Window &gt; Show
View &gt; Other &gt; RPM Plugin Log Viewer</b>. The <b>RPM Plugin Log
Viewer</b> selection is shown below:</p>
<p><img src="../images/15_eclipse_rpm_logviewer.png"></p>
<p>Once this is done, a tab in the Eclipse console window should appear
labeled <b>RPM Plugin Log Viewer</b>. The display should appear as in
the example below:</p>
<p><img src="../images/16_eclipse_rpm_logviewer.png"></p>
<p>The <b>RPM log</b> view shows the last log generated by the RPM
plugin. The name of the logfile that the viewer displays is kept in a
file in the RPM work area designated by the preference page. So, if <code>/var/tmp</code>
is the designated work area, the file would be named <code>/var/tmp/.logfilename_userid</code>,
where userid is your login id. Each time an import/export is performed,
the filename is changed, and the log viewer picks it up and displays
it.
