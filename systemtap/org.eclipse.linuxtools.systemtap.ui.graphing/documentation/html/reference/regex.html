Regular expressions are used in SystemTap GUI to define how the GUI interprets information that it receives
from the script file. If the user wishes to change the regular expression during runtime they may do so by
selecting <b><u>E</u>dit-&gt;Modify <u>P</u>arsing Expression</b>.<br/><br/>

Basic regex (taken from <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/</a> ) -
