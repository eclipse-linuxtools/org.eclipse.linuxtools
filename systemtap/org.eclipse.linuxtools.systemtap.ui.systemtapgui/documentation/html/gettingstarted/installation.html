<h2>
Installation
</h2>

This section details the steps required for the installation of Systemtap GUI on the user's machine.

<h3>
Requirements
</h3>

<b>Hardware Requirements:</b>
<ul><li>x86, x86_64, ppc64, s390</li></ul>

<b>Sotware Requirements:</b>
<ul>
<li>Linux kernel v2.6.14 or newer</li>
<li>Eclipse v3.4.1</li>
<li>SystemTap v0.7 or newer</li>
</ul>

The Gui is a client-server application and the server and client can be installed seperately. The client is an eclipse plugin and requires eclipse to be installed. It provides an IDE to write scripts and a visualizer to view the output in graphical form.
 The server (stapgui-server) provides stdout/stderr data collection and process management services for processes run on a remote system. The  server executes the SystemTap script, collects all output to stderr and stdout from that process, then funnels it via a socket to the client.
The client and server can be installed on machines with different architectures.This allows users to monitor remote machines. You may also download and build the source yourself.

<br><b>NOTE: The client and server are seperate packages and need to be installed independently.</b> You are viewing this help on the eclipse based client.</br>
 
<br>NOTE: Installation assumes you already have both Eclipse and SystemTap installed.

<h3>Server</h3>

<ol>
<li>Install the systemtapguiserver rpm.</li> 
     Eg on Fedora run the command:
      yum install systemtapguiserver
<li> Run the command 'stapgui-server'. You will get a message saying "Listening for Connections..." in a minute or so which shows that the server is up and running.</li> 
</ol>

<h3>Client</h3>
<ol>
<li> Install the  eclipse-systemtapgui rpm.</li>
     Eg on Fedora run the command:
      yum install eclipse-systemtapgui
<li>Launch eclipse and open the SystemTap IDE perspective to start writing scripts.</li>
</ol>
