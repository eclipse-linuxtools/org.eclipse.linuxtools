		<h2 id="Getting_Started">Getting Started</h2>
		<h3 id="IDE_Tutorial">IDE Tutorial</h3>
		<h4 id="Lesson_1:_Getting_Started">Lesson 1: Getting Started</h4>
		<p>In this tutorial we will orient you with the SystemTap IDE and its functions. At this point we assume
			that you are able to run SystemTap plug-in and are unfamiliar with how to proceed. If you cannot yet start
			the application, please refer to our 
			<a href="#Installation">Installation help page</a>.

			<b>NOTE:</b> If this is your the first time opening the SystemTap IDE, it will take a while to load as it has to parse the tapsets.
		</p>
		<p>The SystemTap IDE's purpose is to allow the user to create, view, and edit SystemTap scripts. There are
			other editors built in (plain text and the C editor), however, they ultimately exist to facilitate the writing of SystemTap scripts.</p>
		<p>In this lesson we will open a new SystemTap script file to familiarize ourselves with the SystemTap IDE.
			If you don't already have a project you plan to put your new script in, start by creating a new one.
			Select the <u>F</u>ile menu -&gt; New -&gt; Project -&gt; General -&gt; Project. Follow the wizard to create a new project.</p>
		<p>Now you are ready to create the script. Select File -&gt; New -&gt; Other -&gt; SystemTap -&gt; SystemTap Script. Follow the wizard to provide your script name and the project which will contain it (use the project we created above).</p>
		<p>This should open up a new editor with a small stub of a script.</p>
		<p>At this point proceed to 
			<a href="#Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script</a> if you wish to learn how to write your own script file or 
			<a href="#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script</a> if you wish to run this one.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script</h4>
		<p>In this tutorial we will guide you through the process of writing your first SystemTap script. It is strongly recommended that you review the 
			<b>SystemTap website's tutorial</b> - 
			<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/tutorial">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/tutorial</a> for up-to-date information on the latest version of SystemTap.
		</p>
		<p>In the previous lesson we created a new script and opened it in the editor.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Newfile.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Now try writing a new script or type/copy the following example:</p>
		<pre>global read, write, start

probe begin {
	start = gettimeofday_s()
}

probe syscall.write {
	write += count
}

probe timer.ms(1000) {
	printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", (gettimeofday_s()-start), read, write)
	read=0
	write=0
}
</pre>
		<p>Now to demonstrate the functionality of the Probe Alias browser we will have you complete the read probe yourself. Start by opening the syscall folder in the Probe Alias browser. If you do not have any content in the browser, you are experiencing a problem with SystemTap installation and should refer to our 
			<a href="#Installation">Installation help page</a>. Now search for the "syscall.read" probe alias and double click it. SystemTap IDE will insert the skeleton probe at the end of your script, and should look similar to the following:
		</p>
		<pre>probe syscall.read
{
	/*
	 * available variables on this probe:
	 * $buf:long int, $count:long int, $fd:long int, $ret:long int,
	 * argstr:string, buf_uaddr:long, count:long, fd:long, name:string
	 */

}
</pre>
		<p>Now insert the following line into the syscall.read probe:</p>
		<pre>read += count
</pre>
		<p>You may remove the comment (/* ... */) if you wish. This will count the number of bytes read and written each second and print it out. The begin probe executes first, by getting the time of day. The read and write probes increment each time the function is called. The timer probe prints the information every second.</p>
		<p>Another way to get assistance while writing a new probe is to press Ctrl+Space at any point during editing. Doing so will provide auto-completion for partially spelled probe names, what variables and functions are available inside a probe, and documentation where available.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ContextAssist.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In 
			<a href="#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3</a> you will learn how to run SystemTap scripts.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script</h4>
		<p>In this lesson we will cover running your script. You may use either the script you wrote in Lesson two or write a new one.</p>
		<p>There are two ways to run a script:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Run_exc.gif"/> 
				<b>Simple Run</b> - Clicking this button in the toolbar will run the current script as the current user on the local machine, and will print all script output to the Eclipse console.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Run Configuration</b> - For more control over running options, you can use a Run Configuration. To run a script with an existing Run Configuration, open the script file you want to run, then do any of the following:
				<ul>
					<li>right-click on the script editor or the script file in the Project Explorer, and select 
						<b>Run As-&gt;SystemTap Script</b>
					</li>
					<li>click on the 
						<img border="0" src="images/Run_exc.gif"/> 
						<b>Run As...</b> button on the toolbar
					</li>
					<li>select either 
						<b>Run-&gt;Run</b> or 
						<b>Run-&gt;Run As-&gt;SystemTap Script</b> on the menu bar
					</li>
					<li>press Ctrl+F11 on the keyboard</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If any of these options are used when a Run Configuration is not yet created for the script, a new one with default settings will be created for it. If multiple Run Configurations exist, you will be prompted to select which one to run the script with.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Multiconfigs.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>If you know which Run Configuration you want to use, you may simply click the arrow next to the 
			<img border="0" src="images/Run_exc.gif"/> 
			<b>Run As</b> button on the toolbar and select from a list of recently-run configurations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/RunConfigDropDown.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To create a new Run Configuration, right-click on the script editor or the script file in the Project Explorer then select 
			<b>Run As -&gt; Run Configurations...</b>. Once the dialogue pops up, double click on the SystemTap tree item and you should be presented with the following dialogue:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/SystemTapRunConfiguration.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Here you can specify the path of the script to run, enter remote host information, run as a different user, as well as various other options for running SystemTap. Explore the various tabs and options. The tooltips should provide help in understanding what the various options do. When you are ready, click Run to run your script.</p>
		<p>Now we will demonstrate running SystemTap scripts with graphs. In order to run the chart example you'll need to use the code provided in 
			<a href="#Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script</a>:
		</p>
		<pre>global read, write, start

probe begin {
	start = gettimeofday_s()
}

probe syscall.write {
	write += count
}

probe syscall.read {
	read += count
}

probe timer.ms(1000) {
	printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", (gettimeofday_s()-start), read, write)
	read=0
	write=0
}
</pre>
		<p>To do this, select 
			<b>Run As -&gt; Run Configurations...</b> and create a new SystemTap Launch Configuration as you did previously and switch to the Graphing tab. By the end of this tutorial, the tab will look like this:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/GraphingTab.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The following instructions will walk you through the steps towards configuring the graph settings as shown above.</p>
		<p>First, select 
			<b>Graph the output of this script run</b>, and in the text box labeled 
			<b>Regular Expression</b>, enter a regular expression that will match the output of your script. Place parentheses () around whatever data you want to capture for graphing.
		</p>
		<p>For this example, enter the following as your 
			<b>Regular Expression</b>:
		</p>
		<pre>(\d+)\t(\d+)\t(\d+)
</pre>
		<p>Alternatively, you can click the button labeled 
			<b>Click here to generate regular expressions from printf statements.</b> Clicking this button will automatically create regular expressions that will capture output created by the script's printf statements.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/AutoGraphAfter.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This expression will capture the output produced by the example script. Note that in order to capture data from script output, the output must be formatted into lines/rows. Output-parsing regular expressions try to match individual lines of script output, so make sure your scripts print a line break ("\n") to mark the end of a line. (The line break character does not need to be included in the regular expression.)</p>
		<p>Once this expression is entered, a table of 
			<b>Title</b>s and 
			<b>Sample Extracted Value</b>s will appear. To test that your regular expression is working as intended, you may enter as 
			<b>Sample Output</b> a line of text similar to what you expect your script to produce.
		</p>
		<p>For this example, copy and paste the following line into the 
			<b>Sample Output</b> box:
		</p>
		<pre>10	1000	100
</pre>
		<p>and enter the following as 
			<b>Titles</b>:
		</p>
		<pre>Time
Reads
Writes
</pre>
		<p>The text boxes displayed under 
			<b>Sample Extracted Value</b> now show you the values that are captured by your regular expression, which will be plotted in any graphs you create that use those values.
		</p>
		<p>Now to add a graph using the parsed output, click the 
			<b>Add...</b> button in the Graph Set section, which will bring up the 
			<a href="SystemTap-Graphing.html#Create_Graph_Wizard">Create Graph</a> wizard. Select a line graph as the 
			<b>Graph Type</b>, and enter the following as your Title and series values, then click 
			<b>Finish</b> to save your changes:
		</p>
		<pre>Title:		Read Write Count
X Series:	Time
Y Series 0:	Reads
Y Series 1:	Writes
</pre>
		<p>You may also specify additional regular expressions to capture output with. To do this, either press the Down arrow key while typing into the 
			<b>Regular Expression</b> text box, or click the drop-down arrow of the text box and click the entry labeled 
			<b>New Regular Expression...</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/SystemtapNewRegex.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You will notice that all data entered in the Graphing menu so far, such as the sample output and graphs, will no longer visible after adding a new regular expression. This is because each regular expression has its own sample output, column titles, and set of graphs (or Graph Set) associated with it. Data for the currently-selected expression is displayed, and since the current expression is blank, so are the column &amp; graph settings.</p>
		<p>To capture the example script's output only at intervals of 10 units of time, use the line below as your second regular expression:</p>
		<pre>(\d+0)\t(\d+)\t(\d+)
</pre>
		<p>Enter the same sample output &amp; title values that were used for the first regular expression. Also add a graph with the same series data as before, and with a title of "Decade Read Write Counts".</p>
		<p>When the script is executed under this Run Configuration, the Graph Selector view is opened and it will contain a Data View and any graphs you have created, with a tab for each regular expression's set of graphs. The Data View chart is populated with the output from the console. If you click on the tab labeled 
			<b>Graph Set 1</b>, you should see a screen similar to the following:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/SystemtapGraphView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Switch between the graphs in Graph Set 1 and 2 to see the difference between the two graphs you plotted. If you click on the 
			<b>Data View</b> tab of either Graph Set, you will see that the data that is being parsed live from the console:
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/SystemtapGraphDataView.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You may also create new graphs while in this view, to display data captured by your regular expressions in alternate ways. To create a new graph, first select the Graph Set you want to add a new graph to, then click on the 
			<img border="0" src="images/New_wiz.gif"/> 
			<b>Create Graph</b> button, which appears to the left of the Data View tab. This will bring up the same 
			<a href="SystemTap-Graphing.html#Create_Graph_Wizard">Create Graph</a> wizard that appears when creating a graph in a script's Run Configurations menu.

		<h3 id="Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<p>This section details frequently asked questions relating to the IDE Perspective.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Where can I find information regarding the SystemTap scripting language?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: The best place to look for up to date information regarding SystemTap itself is its homepage - 
			<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>How do I run a script once I've written it?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: There are two ways to run a script:
			-with the 
			<img border="0" src="images/Run_exc.gif"/> Simple Run button on the toolbar, which runs the script that has editor focus. It will be run without drawing graphs or any other configurations.
			-by launching it with a Run Configuration that targets any specified script, even one that is not in the workspace.
		</p>
		<p>Read 
			<a href="#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script</a> and 
			<a href="#Menus">Menus</a> to learn more about the ways of running SystemTap scripts.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Why does the application seem to hang when switching to the SystemTap IDE?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: If this is the first time you are trying to open the SystemTap IDE, or have recently gotten a new version of SystemTap this is expected. In order to generate a full list of all of the available probes and functions, the GUI has to run a background SystemTap process and parse the results. A future update to SystemTap IDE will reduce the duration of this operation.</p>
