	<p>Library Hover Devhelp supplies hover help for library API documentation available in Devhelp format.
		It also makes Devhelp documentation browsable and searchable in the Eclipse help system.</p>
	<p>Library Hover Devhelp works with the documentation generators used most commonly by the GNOME project
		libraries, for example <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/DocumentationProject/GtkDoc">GtkDoc</a>. Other
		kinds of libraries can be supported as well, as long as the API documentation is available in HTML and
		a <strong>*.devhelp2</strong> index file is present.</p>
	<p>The documentation must be installed locally, so an internet connection is not needed to use Library Hover
		Devhelp.</p>
